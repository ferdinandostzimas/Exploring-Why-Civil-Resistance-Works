# Exploring-Why-Civil-Resistance-Works
Indicative data visualization-manipulation and machine learning project based on the assignment authored by AUEB Professor Panos Louridas(Department of Mangement Science and Technology) for the Course of Applied Machine Learning.

The file Exploring-Why-Civil-Resistance-Works.ipynb contains each question of the assignment authored by said professor, followed by each answer authored by myself.

The file used to extract the data for the project is WCRWreplication.dta, the file should be placed in the same folder as the jupyter file containing the code in order for the data to be successfully retrieved. I have uploaded said file in a compressed(.rar) form.
